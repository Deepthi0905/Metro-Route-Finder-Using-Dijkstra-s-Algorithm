🚆 Metro Route Finder Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm


📌 Project Overview
The Metro Route Finder is a Java-based application that calculates the shortest route between two metro stations using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. It takes user input for station connections and distances and finds the most efficient path. The output is visually enhanced with train emojis (🚆) for a more engaging representation.

This project simulates real-world metro navigation systems like Google Maps but is designed specifically for metro routes.

🌟 Features
✅ User-Defined Metro Network – Users can input stations and their distances dynamically.
✅ Shortest Path Calculation – Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the optimal metro route.
✅ Train Emoji Representation (🚆) – Displays routes visually with train emojis for clarity.
✅ Total Distance Calculation – Outputs the total distance of the shortest route.
✅ Efficient Algorithm – Can handle large metro networks efficiently.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Data Structures:
HashMap → To store the metro station graph.
PriorityQueue → To implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm efficiently.
HashSet → To track visited nodes.
Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm (Greedy approach).
User Input Handling: Scanner class for console-based interaction.
🚆 How It Works
1️⃣ User Inputs Metro Stations and Distances

The program asks for the number of metro connections.
The user enters two stations and the distance between them.
2️⃣ User Provides Source and Destination

The user specifies the starting and ending station for route calculation.
3️⃣ Dijkstra’s Algorithm Computes the Shortest Path

The algorithm processes the graph of metro stations and finds the optimal route.
4️⃣ Program Displays the Shortest Path with total dispalys
